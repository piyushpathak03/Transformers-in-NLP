# Transformers-in-NLP

Transformers (formerly known as pytorch-transformers and pytorch-pretrained-bert) provides general-purpose architectures (BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLM, DistilBert, XLNetâ€¦) for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) with over 32+ pretrained models in 100+ languages and deep interoperability between Jax, PyTorch and TensorFlow.

This is the documentation of our repository transformers. You can also follow our online course that teaches how to use this library, as well as the other libraries developed by Hugging Face and the Hub.
